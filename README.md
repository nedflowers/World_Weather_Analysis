# World_Weather_Analysis


## Overview of Project
Collect and present data acquired in real-time from customers, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria to find their ideal hotel anywhere in world. In Jupyter Notebook, use Citipy module to get 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes. With these coordinates, perform requests on the Open Weather map API and add JSON weather data to a Pandas Data Frame. Next, use the weather data to choose the best cities for a vacation based on certain weather criteria. Map these cities using Jupyter's Gmaps module and Google Places API; include a weather description of current conditions. Then, use customerâ€™s input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
